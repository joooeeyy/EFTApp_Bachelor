        <![CDATA[
        I want to create a Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire (TSRQ) Poll with 15 Questions. This questions has 15 items: 6 that assess autonomous motivation, 6 that assess controlled motivation, and 3 that assess amotivation. The autonomous motivation subscale consists of items #1, 3, 6, 8, 11, & 13; the controlled motivation subscale consists of items #2, 4, 7, 9, 12, & 14; and the amotivation subscale consists of items #5, 10, & 15.\n\nFor example the questions could look like this:\n\nThe reason I would do more pushups is:\n\n1. Because I feel that I want to take responsibility for my own fitness.\n2. Because I would feel guilty or ashamed of myself if I didn’t do more pushups.\n3. Because I personally believe it is the best thing for my physical health.\n4. Because others would be upset with me if I didn’t do more pushups.\n5. I really don’t think about it.\n6. Because I have carefully thought about it and believe it is very important for many aspects of my life.\n7. Because I would feel bad about myself if I didn’t do more pushups.\n8. Because it is an important choice I really want to make.\n9. Because I feel pressure from others to do more pushups.\n10. Because it is easier to do what I am told than think about it.\n11. Because it is consistent with my life goals.\n12. Because I want others to approve of me.\n13. Because it is very important for being as fit as possible.\n14. Because I want others to see I can do it.\n15. I don’t really know why.
Please give me only the questions (Please leave out the numbers, ex. 1. 2. and so on)  and the first sentence with the reason, without any overhead as a result, just like the example i gave you.
